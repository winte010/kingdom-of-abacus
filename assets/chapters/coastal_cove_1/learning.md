# The Pearl Keeper is Free!

With a brilliant flash of light, the last magical lock shatters! The Pearl Keeper leaps out of the tidal pool, splashing water everywhere in joy.

"You did it!" the otter cheers, dancing on the sand. "Your math skills are incredible! The Chaos Kraken's magic is no match for you!"

The Pearl Keeper shakes off the water and becomes more serious. "But our work isn't done yet. The Chaos Kraken has scattered precious pearls all across Coastal Cove. These aren't ordinary pearls - they're the **Pearls of Wisdom**, and they keep our land safe and orderly."

The otter points to a series of tide pools stretching along the beach. Some pearls are glowing faintly in the pools, but they're surrounded by swirling chaos fog.

"To collect the pearls, we'll need to hop across the tide pools," the Pearl Keeper explains. "Each jump requires solving an addition problem. The Chaos Kraken may be powerful, but it's not very good at math!"

You notice the Chaos Kraken watching from deep in the ocean, its pink and purple tentacles swirling in frustration. It knows you're helping to restore order to Coastal Cove.

"Are you ready for some tide pool hopping practice?" the Pearl Keeper asks with an encouraging smile. "Take your time - there's no rush. We want to make sure you're ready before we face the Chaos Kraken directly!"

The Pearl Keeper hands you a small bag to collect the pearls. "Let's practice!"
