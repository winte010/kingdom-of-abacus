# Chapter 1: Arrival at Coastal Cove

You open an old, leather-bound book that your grandmother gave you. As you turn the pages, the words begin to glow...

Suddenly, you find yourself standing on a beautiful sandy beach. The air smells of salt and seaweed. Gentle waves lap at the shore, and you can hear the cry of seagulls overhead.

"Welcome, young hero!" a voice calls out.

You turn to see a sea otter standing on its hind legs, wearing a pearl necklace. The otter looks worried.

"I am the Pearl Keeper, guardian of Coastal Cove," the otter says. "Our land is in terrible danger! The Chaos Kraken has trapped me in a tidal pool, and I need your help to escape before the tide comes in!"

The Pearl Keeper explains that only someone with strong math skills can break the magical locks on the tidal pool. The Chaos Fog that's spreading across the kingdom makes everyone confused and forgetful - but you have a secret talent for math that makes you immune to its effects.

"Will you help me?" the Pearl Keeper asks, hope shining in its eyes.

You take a deep breath. Your secret math skills have always felt like something to hide, but now they might save an entire kingdom. You nod with determination.

"Wonderful!" the Pearl Keeper exclaims. "Let's begin!"
