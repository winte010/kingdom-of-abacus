# A Hidden Cave Revealed

As you successfully navigate through the maze of tide pools, something magical happens. A hidden cave entrance appears in the cliff face, revealed by your correct calculations!

"Incredible!" the Pearl Keeper gasps. "This is the Cave of Organizing - I haven't seen it in years! The Chaos Kraken must have hidden it with its fog."

Inside the cave, you find dozens of sea creatures all mixed up together - starfish with sea urchins, crabs with clams, anemones with seahorses. They all look confused and disoriented.

"The Chaos Kraken's magic has scrambled everything," the Pearl Keeper explains sadly. "These creatures need to be organized back into their proper groups. We'll need to use subtraction to figure out how many should go in each pool."

A small seahorse swims up to you, looking hopeful. The Pearl Keeper smiles, "They can sense that you're here to help. Let's organize them back into their families - take your time and be accurate. Each creature is counting on you!"

You roll up your sleeves (figuratively, since you're still on a beach). Time to bring order back to this cave!
