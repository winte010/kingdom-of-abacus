# Chapter 2: Tide Pool Navigation

The morning sun rises over Coastal Cove, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange. You and the Pearl Keeper stand at the edge of a vast network of tide pools.

"Yesterday was amazing!" the Pearl Keeper says, still beaming with pride. "But the Chaos Kraken isn't giving up that easily."

The otter points to the maze of tide pools ahead. "The Kraken has confused all the sea creatures in these pools. They've forgotten where they live and what they do. Some of the smaller pools need to be combined to make proper homes for them."

You notice that the tide pools have numbers floating above them - some show larger numbers than before. The Pearl Keeper explains, "To navigate through these pools and help the creatures, you'll need to add larger numbers together. Can you handle two-digit addition?"

You nod confidently. After yesterday's success, you're ready for a bigger challenge.

"That's the spirit!" the Pearl Keeper cheers. "Let's help these confused creatures find their way home!"
