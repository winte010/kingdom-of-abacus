# The Beach Cleanup

With all the sea creatures safely rescued, you and the Pearl Keeper stand on the beach, looking at the aftermath of the Chaos Kraken's mischief.

"The beach is covered in chaos debris," the Pearl Keeper observes, pointing to various objects scattered across the sand - tangled seaweed, displaced shells, and swirling pockets of fog.

"Before we can face the Chaos Kraken in final battle, we need to clear this beach," the otter explains. "Think of it as warming up. Each piece of debris we remove weakens the Kraken's power over Coastal Cove."

The Pearl Keeper hands you a magical net that glows softly. "Use subtraction to calculate how much debris to remove from each area. The cleaner the beach, the weaker the Kraken becomes!"

You notice the Chaos Kraken watching from far out at sea. Its pink and purple tentacles are moving more slowly than before - it's getting tired from all your victories.

"This is our chance!" the Pearl Keeper says with determination. "Let's clean up this beach and prepare for the final confrontation. The Kraken won't be able to terrorize Coastal Cove anymore!"

You grip the magical net tightly. One more practice session, then it's time to end this once and for all.
