# Chapter 3: The Final Challenge

The very next day, storm clouds gather over Coastal Cove. The Pearl Keeper rushes to find you on the beach, looking more worried than you've ever seen.

"It's the Chaos Kraken!" the otter cries. "It's making one last desperate attempt to keep Coastal Cove in chaos. Look!"

You follow the Pearl Keeper's gaze to see several sea creatures stranded on small rocks as the tide goes out. They're calling for help, but swirling chaos fog surrounds each rock.

"We need to rescue them quickly," the Pearl Keeper says urgently. "But here's the tricky part - we can't just add up numbers to save them. We need to use subtraction to figure out the safest paths. The Kraken is getting smarter!"

You take a deep breath. You've come so far, and these creatures need you. Subtraction might be trickier than addition, but you're ready.

"I knew I could count on you," the Pearl Keeper says warmly. "Let's save our friends!"
