2. **Adaptive Learning** - Side quests trigger when player struggles with specific topics
3. **Book Framing** - Cozy bedtime book aesthetic that opens into epic adventure
4. **Story-Driven** - Every math problem advances the narrative
5. **Progressive Difficulty** - 5 difficulty levels per topic with automatic adjustment
6. **Meaningful Stakes** - Grand Gathering must happen or the Kingdom falls into chaos

## 📚 STORY STRUCTURE

### The Magic Book
- Hero reads the same book every night before bed
- One night, the book changes - it's a call for help
- Only works in the hands of someone secretly good at math
- Serves as the interface for the entire game

### The Threat
- **The Order of Chaos** has invaded the Kingdom of Abacus
- They've cast the **Chaos Fog** that affects anyone who openly loves math
- They've stolen ceremonial items needed for the **Grand Gathering**
- They've trapped the six **Land Keepers**
- Without the celebration, the lands will divide and chaos will reign

### The Hero's Journey
- Free each Land Keeper (becomes companion for that region)
- Defeat chaos agents in each land
- Recover ceremonial items
- Reach Central City for the Grand Gathering
- Be knighted as Champion of the Kingdom

## 🎮 GAME MECHANICS

### Core Loop
1. **Book Pages** - Story text with embedded low-drama practice problems
2. **Unlock Mechanic** - Solve problems to reveal next part of story
3. **Gameplay Scene** - High-drama challenges (hopping rocks, navigating obstacles)
4. **Boss Battle** - Timed problems with health/damage system
5. **Victory** - Ceremonial item obtained, land restored
6. **Transition** - Book page turns to next chapter

### Difficulty System
**5 Levels per Topic:**
- Very Easy (introductory)
- Easy (building confidence)
- Medium (grade-level appropriate)
- Hard (challenge mode)
- Very Hard (mastery)

**Adaptive Logic:**
- 80%+ accuracy → move up
- 70-79% → stay at level
- Below 70% → move down or trigger side quest
- 3+ errors on specific fact family → automatic side quest

### Side Quests
**Trigger:** Struggle with specific topics (e.g., 6x tables, 7+8 combinations)

**Structure:**
- "Pocket Realm" appears - trapped creature needs help
- Focused practice on weak area (5-10 problems)
- Must achieve 80% to return to main story
- Bonus reward upon completion
- Encouraging narrative wrapper

**Examples:**
- "The 6-Dragon is trapped! Only problems with 6 can free them!"
- "The 7-Spirits need your help! Solve additions with 7!"

### Timer Adaptation (Boss Battles)
- **Initial:** 10 seconds per problem
- **If 2 wrong in a row:** Add 5 seconds
- **If 4 wrong in a row:** Add 10 seconds
- **Visual cue:** Timer color changes (red → yellow → green)
- **Message:** "Take your time - you're learning!"
